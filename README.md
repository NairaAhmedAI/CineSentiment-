# üé¨ Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews  

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** of IMDB movie reviews, a classic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** task.  
The main objective is to classify each review as either **Positive** or **Negative** by building a complete pipeline that covers:  

- Data Collection  
- Text Preprocessing  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models (next steps)  

By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to transform raw unstructured text into clean and meaningful representations that can be used for predictive modeling.

## üìä Dataset  
We used the **IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**, which contains **25,000 positive** and **25,000 negative** reviews.  
This dataset is widely used for benchmarking sentiment classification models.

## üõ† Data Preprocessing  

Preprocessing is a critical step in NLP as raw text is often noisy and inconsistent. We applied several transformations to prepare the dataset:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Lowercasing  
All reviews were converted to lowercase to maintain consistency and avoid duplication caused by case sensitivity.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Label Encoding  
The target variable (**sentiment**) was encoded into numeric values:  
- `0` ‚Üí Negative  
- `1` ‚Üí Positive  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning (Regex-based)  
- Removed **emojis** and **hashtags**  
- Removed HTML tags such as `<br>`  
- Normalized text by stripping unnecessary characters  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenization & Stopword Removal  
Using **NLTK**, we split sentences into individual tokens (words).  
Stopwords (e.g., *is, the, and*) were removed to reduce noise, but **negation words** (e.g., *not, no*) were kept as they strongly influence sentiment.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Lemmatization with POS Tagging  
- Applied **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** to identify word categories (noun, verb, adjective, adverb).  
- Used **WordNet Lemmatizer** from NLTK to reduce words to their base form (e.g., *running ‚Üí run*, *better ‚Üí good*).  

This step ensures that semantically similar words are treated the same way, improving model generalization.

## üîë Why NLTK?  
The **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** is a powerful and widely-used Python library for NLP.  
It provides tools for:  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword filtering  
- POS tagging  
- Lemmatization  
- Corpora and lexical resources (WordNet)  

Its flexibility and ease of use make it an excellent choice for preprocessing in text classification projects like this one.  

# ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

After preprocessing the IMDB dataset, we trained several **classical machine learning models** to classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**.  
Each model was trained using **TF-IDF** or **Bag-of-Words** representations, then evaluated on the test set.
